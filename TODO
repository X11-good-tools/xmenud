Bugs
 * Defered image loading.

Maybe
 * Read other menus
   * other xdg menus, perhaps?
   * menus in another format
 * find a more shiny icon
 * make it a menu bar with categories as top level items

Done
 * what to do if the menu is missing altogether? -> give an error and exit ;)
 * Command line switch to return the command to stdout instead of executing. -p
 * Fix that About-dialog bug. -> replaced by making it possible to open multiple of them.
 * Fixed the wesnoth_editor empty Exec string bug. Just returns '' now.
 * handle broken .desktop entries (fixed the wesnoth-bug at least) - doing proper parsing now.
