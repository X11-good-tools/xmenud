Bugs
 * Defered image loading.
 * handle broken .desktop entries (fixed the wesnoth-bug at least)
 * what to do if the menu is missing altogether?

Maybe
 * Read other menus
   * other xdg menus, perhaps?
   * menus in another format
 * find a more shiny icon

Done
 * Command line switch to return the command to stdout instead of executing. -p
 * Fix that About-dialog bug. -> replaced by making it possible to open multiple of them.
 * Fixed the wesnoth_editor empty Exec string bug. Just returns '' now.
